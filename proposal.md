**Topic and aim of the Hackathon (20-100 characters, including spaces)**
Collaborate on a manuscript discussing the ways Ecologists and Evolutionary Biologists use GitHub.
 
**Why do you think this Hackathon is relevant to open / reliable / transparent ecology, evolutionary biology, or related disciplines? (100-400 characters, including spaces)**

Researchers, scientific journals, and data repositories have increasingly focused on scientific data being more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). Yet, a large number of new publications within ecology and evolution still lack adherence to FAIR code- and data-sharing policies (Culina et al. 2020).

GitHub is a popular version control platform that can be leveraged for sharing code and data, yet the learning curve may deter first-time users in EEB. In this hackathon, we will share, discuss, and brainstorm innovative ways to use GitHub for collaboration and sharing information that aligns with research and career goals for EEB researchers.

‘GitHub hesitancy’ due to conflation of Git and GitHub. People may overestimate the conceptual leap from their current collaborative approaches to GitHub
Speeds up and democratizes sharing of knowledge at all stages of research
Reduces redundant work across research groups

**Please provide a brief outline for how you plan to coordinate the Hackathon (100-1000 characters, including spaces)**

Our hackathon will begin with the session organizers communicating the goals, code of conduct, and authorship plans for any resulting work.

We will have a very short introduction to the power of Git and GitHub in EEB research. The session organizers will each share one-minute examples of how they have used GitHub for their programming and non-programming work. 

Depending on the number of attendees, participants will move into one of five breakout rooms focused on different use cases of GitHub: 1) visualizing data and results; 2) career-supporting resources; 3) research documentation; 4) programming and code support;  5) Other.  Each breakout room will take their topic, and describe examples, challenges, and the advantages of using GitHub for the chosen use case.

We will end the session by discussing our plans for moving the manuscript forward including writing a blogpost, a preprint of the manuscript, and then ultimately a manuscript for a peer-reviewed journal.

**Who could actively participate in the Hackathon? While all conference attendees should feel welcome to watch the Hackathon, if specialised skills would be required for active participation, please describe the level of proficiency advisable for active participants. (20-300 characters, including spaces).
**
Basic knowledge of GitHub may be helpful, anyone who collaborates on documents, website development, manuscripts or is interested in data- and code-sharing policies could contribute to the more general question of “How can collaboration and data sharing be made easier in Ecology and Evolution?”.

**Please describe what the participants would find engaging about participating in the Hackathon (100-300 characters, including spaces).**

Participants will walk away with an understanding of how Ecologists and Evolutionary Biologists use GitHub in innovative ways that do not require proficiency with Git nor special coding skills. Our plan to work on a collaborative manuscript will create long-term engagement among the participants. 

**If Hackathon outcomes would require further work from the participants and/or coordinators after the conference, please provide a brief plan for how this would be achieved (0-300 characters, including spaces).**

Two months after the hackathon, session organizers will write a blog post on the discussions that took place in the hackathon. We expect to complete a manuscript by collaborating through remote monthly meetings, conversing over a Slack channel, and creating a collaborative manuscript on GitHub.

**If the Hackathon conveners anticipate producing content with publicly identified authorship, please submit a simple set of guidelines for determining authorship (0-500 characters, including spaces).**

Both a blog post and manuscript will result from this hackathon. The session organizers will be listed as first seven authors, then other contributors will be listed in alphabetical order. Collaborators from the SORTEE hackathon can also propose inviting other colleagues.


**Please estimate the minimum and maximum lengths (in hours) of the Hackathon that you believe would be engaging for participants. (range they offer is 1-6 hrs)**

3 hours
